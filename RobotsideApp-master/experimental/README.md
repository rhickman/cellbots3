# Experimental directory
This experimental directory is for quick trial and error with bypassing formal code review process.

# Code review
None. Free to merge.

# Encourage vs discourage
In general we expect you to move the code under your directory to a proper location after a fomal
code review. You will add your code here after considering prototyping speed, reusability of
your code, and time for code quality improvement.
